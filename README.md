# Atlas

## TODO

* Build time config schema enforcement
* Dotenv Vault extension for safely sealing new production secrets ("FireSafe")
* Expo integration for Mobile
* Docker + GCP via Pulumi for deployment

## Open Questions

* Any easy way to enforce a single set of "common libraries" without copying into every single package.json? radash, date-fns, adze.
* What component library for web + mobile?
