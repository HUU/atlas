# Atlas

## TODO

### Code Complete

* Build time config schema enforcement
* Web libraries (forms, dates, tanstack query, component library)
* Mobile libraries (component library)
* Google and Apple Authentication

### Production Readiness

* APM (crashes)
* Metrics+Logs
* Product Analytics
* Switching environments inside the mobile app
* Docker + GCP via Pulumi for deployment
* GitHub CI/CD

## Open Questions

* Any easy way to enforce a single set of "common libraries" without copying into every single package.json? radash, date-fns, adze.
* What component library for web + mobile?
