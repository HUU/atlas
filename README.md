# Stack Choices

* Web
  * Tanstack Start
  * Can I use Tanstack Start with ts-rest?
  * Database will be PostgreSQL
  * Probably Drizzle for an ORM or Kyseley for a query builder but I'm not sure
    yet.
* Backends
  * Vite + Turbo
* Mobile
  * Expo
  * Component Library???
* Secrets
  * Use dotenv-vault
  * Hosted "vault updater" service that takes new secrets, writes them into the
    vault, and then lets you download the resulting file. Also list/read contents
    to know if a secret exists or not.

* Open Questions
  * Config wrapper (the "explode when config is missing" thing really sucked and
    was surprising/confusing.)
  * Logging library that works across frontend and backend...not Winston.
