# Atlas

## TODO

* Build time config schema enforcement
* Docker + GCP via Pulumi for deployment
* GitHub CI/CD
* Web libraries (forms, dates, tanstack query, component library)
* Mobile libraries (component library)
* APM (crashes)
* Metrics+Logs
* Product Analytics
* Google and Apple Authentication
* Switching environments inside the mobile app

## Open Questions

* Any easy way to enforce a single set of "common libraries" without copying into every single package.json? radash, date-fns, adze.
* What component library for web + mobile?
